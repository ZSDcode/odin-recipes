        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>2 Potatoes</li>
                <li>2 Garlic Cloves</li>
                <li>Butter (Add to your own discretion)</li>
                <li>Milk (Half and half or half and heavy cream to amp things up!)</li>
                <li>Cream Cheese (For an extra tinge)</li>
                <li>Fine sea salt</li>
                <li>Toppings (Optional)</li>

        </p>
        <h2>Steps!</h2>
        <p>
            This is where the magic happens:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Cut the potatoes.</strong> Up to you on whether the skins should be left on them or not but cut evenly.</li>
                <li><strong>Boil the potatoes.</strong> About 10 to 12 minutes until the potato becomes soft. At this stage, you can also add some salt to season it up!</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare your Butter mixture!</strong> Crucially, Heat your butter and milk till the butter melts and set it aside.</li>
                <li><strong>Pan-dry the Potatoes.</strong> Using the same pot, now lower the heat, remove the water and allow the potatoes to evaporate off some excess water.</li>
                <li><strong>Mash the potatoes.</strong> Mash to your liking!</li>
                <li><strong>Stir everything together!</strong> Taking your melted butter, stir into the potatoes slowly, folding the potatoes over . 
                    But don't overmix, slow and steady is the trick!</li>
                <li><strong>Taste and season!</strong> You're almost done, now just tuning and adding of toppings or more salt.</li>
                <li><strong>Time to serve!</strong></li>
            </ol>
